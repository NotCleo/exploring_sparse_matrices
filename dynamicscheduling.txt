#pragma omp parallel for private(i, j) schedule(dynamic)
for (i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) { ... }


//added to the OpenMP directive with schedule(dynamic).
//Reason: Sparse matrices have uneven non-zero distributions per row, so dynamic scheduling balances workload across threads, preventing some threads from finishing early while others are still processing dense rows.
